Welcome to the SIG, Brain Sciences!

We identify ourselves as a democratic group and each member along with the rights, is entitled to certain duties and rules. Here's a list of the same:

- While talking about any idea, experiment, findings, references to the research papers should be mentioned. Without references, the credibility vanishes to zero.

- If you have been found inactive in the group for more than 2 weeks, you will be removed from the group.

- Discussions on psuedo-sciences will be frowned upon.
<!-- - You will participate in the briefings and the newsletters the group releases -->
