**Goals of the SIG: Brain Sciences:**

- First and foremost the goal of this SIG is to appreciate the big questions in this field. Understand why they matter, what the theoretical context is for those questions. The reason we make a big deal about the questions is that we have more questions and answers right now. It's just where we are in human cognitive neuroscience. We have a few little bits of answers here and there kinda sorta maybe that might change with time but the questions are wonderful and fascinating and rich and the theoretical contexts are fun!

- Goal number two is to understand the methods and what you can learn the the logic of the kind of experiments. We want to get is what was compared to what in the experiment what was the main finding and how did that finding enable the scientists to answer the question right and why did that question matter.
